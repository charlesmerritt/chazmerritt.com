## Overview

**AIDVISOR** is a financial aid assistance platform designed to bridge the gap between students and personalized scholarship opportunities. This New Media Capstone project utilizes large language models (LLMs) through OpenAI's Assistants API to provide personalized support for finding scholarships, grants, and other financial aid resources. The goal is to make higher education more accessible and affordable for all students by going beyond naive keyword matching to truly understand each student's unique background and needs.

## Key Features

* **Personalized Financial Aid Search**: Utilizes LLMs to provide tailored scholarship recommendations based on each student's academic background, interests, and financial situation.
* **Conversational Interface**: Initially prototyped with Gradio and later built in Django, providing an interactive, natural language interface for seamless user experience.
* **Scalable Deployment**: Hosted on Railway for reliable, scalable access.
* **Data Security and Privacy**: Built with Django's robust security features to ensure user data is protected.

## Technologies Used

* **Django**: Backend framework for handling API requests and user data securely.
* **Gradio**: Early-stage prototyping and conversational interface development.
* **OpenAI Assistants API**: Core LLM integration for personalized scholarship recommendations.
* **Railway**: Deployment platform for scalable hosting.

## Challenges and Learnings

Developing AIDVISOR presented unique challenges, including integrating LLMs into a real-time, interactive web application and ensuring personalized responses without compromising performance. The project also required careful design to manage sensitive student data securely and efficiently. Building this system provided valuable experience in full-stack development, machine learning integration, and API design.

## Outcome

AIDVISOR has empowered students to find financial aid opportunities that align closely with their personal stories and academic goals, reducing the financial barrier to higher education. This project has proven the value of AI-driven personalization in making education more accessible.
