	I'm a lifelong learner, AI/ML researcher, and builder. My work bridges theory and application—
	designing intelligent systems that solve real problems at scale. I’m driven by curiosity, 
	committed to rigor, and always building toward what's next. Whether it's founding projects or 
	pushing the limits of machine learning, I stay hands-on, focused, and future-oriented.
